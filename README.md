# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 
Software engineering deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications
Mordern software engineering differs from tradition programming because it uses simpler and more human readable languages


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
It contains six phases: concept, inception, iteration, release, maintenance and retirement.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile Software Development Life Cycle is structured in a series of stages that a product goes through as it moves from beginning to  end.
Waterfall Models:  is a sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all phases of a project (analysis, design, development, and testing, for example), with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins.
Agile is suitable for projects requiring flexibility and constant requirements changes, such as software development, where customer feedback and engagement are critical. On the other hand, Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined stages and straightforward, linear requirements.


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.It is important because it is used to translate the imprecise, incomplete needs and wishes of the potential users of software into complete, precise and formal specifications 


Software Design Principles: 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It aims to improve software development by partitioning complex problems into more manageable sub-problems.By breaking down a large software system into smaller modules, developers can focus on writing code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain.
Testing in Software Engineering: Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it's supposed to do.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is a method of testing individual units or components of a software application.
Integration testing is a method of testing how different units or components of a software application interact with each other.
System testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully intergrated software solution.
Testing is crucial in software development because it helps improve software quality and reliability.


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
 Are a category of software tools that help in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done in the code.
 Git is an example of a version control system that is used to manage the versions of your computer programs and work on programs in conjunction with other developers.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Project managers serve as a liaisons between the development team and the other stakeholders in a software project. They are responsible for communicating project status, managing changes and requesting additional resources to help complete the project.Some of the chalanges are misalignment between goals and business objectives,communication,lack of accountability and many more.


Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance refers to thee process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer.It is essencial because it keeps the software system working correctly, efficiently and securely and to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the users.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
some ethical issues software engineers might face are data privacy, accessibility, addictive design and algorithmic bias.
Engineers should also prioritise security measures, implementing robust authentication and encryption mechanisms to protect user data.


Submission Guidelines:

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
